  requirements:
    - Check against 'policies' section first.

policy_repositories:
  description: "External or internal policy repositories used for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or reference."

    # Example entry:
    # - name: "Example Corp Policy RAG DB"
    #   url: "https://policies.example.com/rag-db"
    #   type: "vector-db"
    #   notes: "Internal use only. Contains all HR and security policies."

# The 'policies' section below contains the top 10 common company policies directly listed in this YAML file.
# These are used for local, deterministic policy checks and reference.
#
# If a policy or compliance check is requested that is not covered by the listed policies,
# the system will attempt to retrieve relevant policy information from external/internal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) DBs
# as defined in the 'policy_repositories' section above. Key phrases from the incoming input prompt request
# will be used to query the RAG DB for the most relevant policy content.
